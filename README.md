- AlignLog: align log

## Goal

- Add automation program with adding least code to original code
    1. Modification to the original code should be limited to adding new lines whenever possible
- Original features can be removed for optimization
- There are no plans to add visual features
- There are no plans to add ability to interact with the gui

## Convention

- `_<identifier>`: Prepend `_` to identifiers with private access modifier
- Don't omit `invoker` of method which is not private method(ex> this.method(), ClassName.method())

## Next plan

- Add api to interact with items
- Create automation program building drying frame
